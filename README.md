# Integrating DLL in a hybrid architecture
Thesis Implementation: Neuro-Symbolic AI for Legal Concept Drift Detection, GISMA University, 2025

This repo accompanies my NSAI dissertation submission and demos how defeasible deontic logic combines with neuro‑symbolic AI to spot legal concept drift across regulatory frameworks.

# Contents
1. NSAI_Thesis_code.ipynb – full pipeline notebook (Legal-BERT embeddings → statistical drift tests → DDL reasoning → compliance dashboard).
2. CUAD_v1/ – curated subset of the CUAD contract dataset used for baseline and current document comparison.

# How to use it? 
- Create a Python 3.10+ environment and all dependencies.
- Launch the notebook.
- Run all cells to reproduce the drift analysis, reasoning trace, and visualisations.
